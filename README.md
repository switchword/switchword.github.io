# Switchword

In this game, you switch the letters of the initial word with the letters of the final word, one letter at a time, making valid words at each step. Letters can shift position at each step.

Usually, there are many solutions to each puzzle, many paths you can follow. Each puzzle has at least one solution with only frequently used words that also do not include names and abbreviations. You don't have to find this solution, of course. You can use any word that is in the dictionary, it just needs to head towards the final word.

The game can be played with the mouse or on a touchscreen, or with the keyboard.
* Change language with **Escape**
* Start a new game with **4**-**8**, at any time, abandoning the current puzzle
* When you have given an invalid word, you can use **!** to get a hint

The game is inspired by <https://letter-lattice.com/>. I read about this game and wanted to play it, but it is released only for iOS devices. As I do not have access to such a device, I created a more freely available pure-javascript web game. Enjoy. More languages will follow soon.

The validation of the words is done with word lists from:
* <https://github.com/en-wl/wordlist>
* <https://github.com/LibreOffice/dictionaries>

The frequency data come from <https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords>.
